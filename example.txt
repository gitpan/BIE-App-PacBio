=head1 EXAMPLE DATA

The L<data|http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/manuscripts/PacBio_Data> provides an example for PacBio CCS data,
which was used in our data analysis, software and algorithm development.

It is from a project of de novo sequencing for B<MSG> isoforms in human I<pneumocystis>.
I<Pnuemocystis> is a fungus which could infect people with depressed immunity, such as cancer patient, AIDS patient. It affects much the life quality and shortens the life time of those patients.
B<MSG> is the I<major surface glycoprotein> located on the surface of I<pneumocystis>.
B<MSG> is believed to be very critical in I<pneumocystis> invading hosts.
Yet people don't know much about B<MSG> gene.
That is why we wanted to sequence B<MSG>.

There are about 50 to 100 copies of B<MSG> gene on I<pneumocystis> genome.
The similarity among them is in the range of 80~90%.
The high similarity hurdled assembly very much when we tried other short-read sequencing platforms.
PacBio RS can produce long accurate read, which greatly facilitates our B<MSG> sequencing.

The example data contains the mixture of 10 known 1.5kb known B<MSG> fragments, which was used as a control in our PacBio sequencing.
Researchers could use it to test our QC software and the upcoming algorithm for quality improving.
